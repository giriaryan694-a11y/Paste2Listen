## 🧠 Philosophy

Kevin Mitnick once said that technology itself isn’t dangerous —  
**how we use it defines its impact**.

Paste2Listen is built with the idea of:
- reducing cognitive load  
- enabling learning without eye strain  
- keeping everything offline and private  

No accounts.  
No tracking.  
No data collection.

Just text → sound.
