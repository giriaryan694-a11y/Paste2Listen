## 🧠 Philosophy

Kevin Mitnick once said that technology itself isn’t dangerous —  
**how we use it defines its impact**.

Paste2Listen is built with the idea of:
- reducing cognitive load  
- enabling learning without eye strain  
- keeping everything offline and private  

No accounts.  
No tracking.  
No data collection.

Just text → sound.

## ⚠️ Mobile Limitation

Paste2Listen works best on **desktop browsers** like Chrome and Edge.

Due to Android OS restrictions, **browser-based Text-to-Speech (Web Speech API)** has limited or no support on many Android devices.

This is an operating system limitation, not a bug in the tool.

For Android users, system features like **Select to Speak** or built-in TTS are recommended.

## 📄 Why PDF Reading Is Not Included

Paste2Listen does **not** support direct PDF reading by design.

PDF files often contain complex layouts such as:
- multi-column text
- scattered paragraphs
- headers, footers, and side notes

When converted to speech, this usually results in:
- incorrect reading order  
- broken sentence flow  
- learner confusion  

For effective listening and understanding, **clean pasted text** is far better than automatic PDF parsing.

This decision prioritizes **learning clarity over feature quantity**.
